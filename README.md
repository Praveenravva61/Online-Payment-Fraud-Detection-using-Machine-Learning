# 💳 Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting **fraudulent online payment transactions** using **machine learning algorithms**. The goal is to build a reliable classification system that identifies suspicious transactions while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

The model analyzes transaction patterns, user behavior, and historical data to accurately classify transactions as **fraudulent or legitimate**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect fraudulent transactions in online payment systems  
- Reduce false negatives (missed fraud cases)  
- Improve transaction security using data-driven insights  
- Compare multiple machine learning models for optimal performance  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  

---

## 📊 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Handling imbalanced datasets  
- Feature engineering for better prediction  
- Model training and evaluation
